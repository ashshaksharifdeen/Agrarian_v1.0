Problem Definition, Analysis and the Solution


Rice production, also known as paddy production, is an important industry in Sri Lanka, providing a staple food for over 21.8 million people and a living for over 1.8 million farmers. Unfortunately, Sri Lankan farmers are facing significant yield challenges, including lower productivity and poor crop quality. Climate change, soil water stress, and plant health are all contributing factors to these problems. Low productivity and crop yields have a significant economic impact and can result in significant losses for farmers, jeopardizing their livelihoods. The root cause of these problems is farmers' lack of understanding of how to manage water stress in soil and plants, as well as how climate change affects plant health affect yield production.

Traditionally, hiring experienced farmers to gain insight and make recommendations for improvement has been the solution to these problems. However, this approach is expensive in terms of both human labor and time, and it may not produce the best results. Implementing autonomous Drone systems that can operate in the field indefinitely and reduce the cost of human labor is an alternative solution. Farmers can obtain valuable information about water stress and plant health, as well as real-time feedback on the impact of climate change on their crops, using these systems. This method is expected to be far more efficient and effective than traditional methods, resulting in increased productivity and crop quality for Sri Lankan farmers.


Paddy cultivation is an important industry in Sri Lanka, providing food and a living for millions of people. Farmers, on the other hand, face significant challenges in managing crop health and nutrition, particularly in terms of leaf area index (LAI), leaf nitrogen concentration, normalized difference vegetation index (NDI), and excess of green. These parameters are important indicators of paddy health and can have a big impact on crop yield and quality.

The leaf area index (LAI) compares the amount of leaf surface area to the amount of ground surface area. Because it affects the plant's ability to photosynthesize and produce energy for growth, LAI is an important parameter for paddy health.

The amount of nitrogen in a leaf is measured by its nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for plant growth and an important factor in crop yield and quality.

Normalized disparity The vegetation index (NDI) is a measurement of how much photosynthetically active radiation a plant absorbs. The NDI is an important parameter for paddy health because it indicates the plant's ability to absorb light and generate energy.

The amount of chlorophyll in a plant is measured by the excess of green. Chlorophyll is required for photosynthesis and is used to assess plant health.




All of these variables are important indicators of paddy health and can have a significant impact on crop yield and quality. Farmers can make informed decisions about how to manage their crops, adjust fertilizer application rates or irrigation schedules to optimize crop health and yield, and adapt to changing environmental conditions by monitoring these parameters in real-time. Using computer vision and RGB cameras to monitor these parameters provides a low-cost and accessible solution for small-scale farmers in Sri Lanka, resulting in higher profits and sustainable paddy production.


Farmers have traditionally relied on costly technologies such as satellite imagery, multispectral cameras, and LAI canopy analyzers to monitor these parameters. However, these methods are frequently prohibitively expensive for many farmers, limiting their ability to effectively manage crop health.

To address this issue, we propose a new, low-cost solution that uses computer vision and RGB cameras to continuously monitor these critical parameters. Farmers can obtain real-time data on LAI, leaf nitrogen concentration, NDI, and excess of green by using computer vision algorithms to analyze images of paddy fields, providing them with critical insights into crop health. In Addition We are getting RGB images from the Drone Camera and constructing Othomosic image and Pointcloud Visulization. We are doing Research more on Segementing the point cloud and give the farmers to better understanding and Visualization of their Paddy field with Location of where the crops are damaged and les growth rate.

This method has several advantages over traditional methods, especially in terms of cost and accessibility. Farmers can monitor crop health using existing RGB cameras at a much lower cost than satellite imagery, multispectral cameras, or LAI canopy analyzers. This method is especially advantageous for small-scale farmers who may not have access to expensive technologies.

The use of computer vision and RGB cameras also provides farmers with a one-of-a-kind tool for increasing production. Farmers can make informed decisions about crop management by obtaining real-time data on LAI, leaf nitrogen concentration, NDI, and excess of green. They can, for example, modify fertilizer application rates or irrigation schedules to improve crop health and yield. As a result, the quality of their yield may improve, resulting in higher profits.

The application of computer vision and RGB cameras is also a novel approach to the problem of managing crop health in changing environmental conditions. Farmers face significant challenges as a result of climate change, and changing weather patterns can have a significant impact on crop health. Farmers can obtain real-time data on the impact of changing weather patterns on their crops by using computer vision and RGB cameras to monitor LAI, leaf nitrogen concentration, NDI, excess of green and Point Cloud. As a result, they will be able to make more informed decisions about how to adapt their farming practices to changing conditions.


Finally, our autonomous drone monitoring solution provides a cost-effective and one-of-a-kind approach to paddy production that can significantly improve crop health, yield, and quality. Our solution Agrarian, which makes use of computer vision and RGB cameras, provides real-time monitoring of critical parameters such as LAI, leaf nitrogen concentration, NDI, and excess green, which are critical for optimizing paddy health and production. Our solution, by reducing the need for human labor, provides a more efficient and accessible method of monitoring and managing paddy production for small-scale farmers in Sri Lanka. Adoption of this self-driving drone monitoring solution can give farmers a competitive advantage and increase profits while also promoting sustainable and responsible agricultural practices.Our solution is scalable and adaptable to changing environmental conditions, making it a critical innovation for the future of paddy production in Sri Lanka.
